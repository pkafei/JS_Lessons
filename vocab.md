# Essential JS Vocabulary

One of the essential ways to wrap your head around a new concept is to learn and use terms and jargon that is related to the language or framework you're learning. You will not only sound smart, but you will be better able to solicit help and precisely describe your bug.


*callback* A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is generally called when the first function is finished. Callbacks are node's way of dealing with concurrency. 

*synchronous or blocking* An execution of code that stops until a function returns. A script is not able to continue if an operation blocks

*asynchronous or non-blocking* Callback-based approach of allowing a script to perform operations in parallel. A script does not need to wait for the outcome of an operation before proceeding, because this will be handled by the callback.
